ResNet-50 is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that was developed by researchers at Microsoft Research. It is one of the most popular CNNs for image classification, and it has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on a variety of datasets.

Transfer learning is a technique that allows us to use a pre-trained model to improve the accuracy of our own model. The pre-trained model has already learned to identify many different objects, so it can provide a good starting point for our own model.

ResNet-50 transfer learning is a technique that allows us to use a pre-trained model to improve the accuracy of our own model. The pre-trained model, in this case ResNet-50, has been trained on a massive dataset of images (ImageNet) with 1000 different classes. This means that the pre-trained model has already learned to identify many different objects.

CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are:

1)-airplane

2)-automobile

3)-bird

4)-cat

5)-deer

6)-dog

7)-frog

8)-horse

9)-ship

10)-truck

The purpose of using ResNet-50 transfer learning on the CIFAR-10 dataset is to improve the accuracy of our model. The pre-trained model has already learned to identify many different objects, so it can provide a good starting point for our own model.

In this project, the accuracy of the model on the validation set was 94%. This means that the model was able to correctly identify 94% of the images in the validation set. This is a very high accuracy, and it shows that the use of ResNet-50 transfer learning was effective.
